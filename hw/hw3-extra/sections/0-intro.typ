= Introduction

The most elegant theorem I've learnt in this course is the pullback property of quotient topologies. While I've been learning Abstract Algebra this semester, I found some generalized facts about this property in category theory. The four problems and sections corresponding answers of this homework are as follows:

1. Prove the theorem. (@pb-qt)
2. In your opinion, what is the most crucial assumption of the theorem? Does the theorem still hold if you remove this assumption? If not, can you construct an example? (@pb-assump)
3. Describe the importance of the theorem. (@pb-cat, @importance)
4. Provide a typical example to exhibit the application of theorem. (@app)
